Logistic regression summary for select experiments.
Null hypothesis: tuber-level statistics are not associated with the epileptogenic focus.
Dependent variables: [0 1] a label indicating whether the lobe is epileptogenic or not.
Independent variables: [a1 a2 ... a8] - variables for individual lobes.
Mode: mask being used. either ground truth or prediction from deep learning.
Vnorm: whether variables are normalized by the volume of each lobe.
Control_lobe: a dummy variable indicating for the lobe is added to control for different lobes.
Znorm: whether variables are znormalized by all subjects. This accounts for different tuber distribution across 8 target lobes
Area(variable): volume of tubers in each lobe normalized by gross lobe volume.
Ntuber(variable): number of tubers in each lobe normalized by gross lobe volume. can be critically affected by CC3D algorithm
Intensity(variable): intensity distribution statistics of tubers in each lobe. Mean | std | 75 percentile | 90 percentile
Cutoff: Holm-Bonferroni cutoff p-value for rejection.
Reject H0: whether the null hypothesis is rejected. True means significant correlation.
Correct: subject numbers with correct prediction for epileptogenic lobe.
Wrong: subject numbers with correct prediction for epileptogenic lobe.
